# NutriLens-AI-Food-Nutrition: Automated Food Identification and Nutritional Analysis

![foodbanner](insert_your_image_url_here)

The surge in nutrition-related ailments worldwide has underscored the importance of maintaining healthy dietary habits. Optimal nutrition not only mitigates the risks associated with food intolerances, weight issues, and malnutrition but also reduces the likelihood of certain types of cancers. While manual methods exist for tracking and identifying food items, they often require prior knowledge or experience with the food in question. But what about encountering a food item for the first time? Automated tools for food identification become invaluable in such scenarios.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning architectures have paved the way for the development of automated food identification systems. Despite significant progress, there remain challenges in achieving high accuracy. In response, we propose a novel approach leveraging a pretrained DenseNet-161 model, bolstered by extensive data augmentation techniques to enhance class separability. Our experimental results, conducted on the Food-101 dataset, demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, with a Top-1 accuracy of 93.27% and Top-5 accuracy of 99.02%.

### Objectives

Our primary objective is to develop an automated system capable of accurately classifying previously unseen food items. Additionally, we aim to explore avenues for identifying critical image components contributing to classifications, detecting new food types, and building object detectors for similar objects within scenes.

### Approach

**Dataset**

We leverage the Food-101 dataset, which provides a diverse array of food images. The dataset is formatted in HDF5, enabling easy access and manipulation.

**Model**

We adopt the DenseNet-161 architecture, renowned for its ability to address vanishing-gradient issues, encourage feature reuse, and reduce parameter count. DenseNet's densely connected layers facilitate feature propagation and learning.

**Image Preprocessing**

PyTorch's transformation utilities are employed for data preprocessing. These transformations include random rotation, resizing, flipping, and normalization. Augmentation techniques are utilized to address variations in image properties and enhance model learning.

**Methodology**

Our model is trained on a machine with an Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB RAM, and an Nvidia GTX 1050ti GPU. Transfer learning is applied by loading a pretrained DenseNet-161 checkpoint and adapting the classifier to our specific task. The dataset is split into training, test, and validation sets, with fine-tuning performed using the Adam optimizer. Various hyperparameters are tuned to optimize model performance and minimize loss.

### Results

We observe significant progress and improved accuracy due to extensive data augmentation techniques. The training process exhibits steady improvement, leading to impressive classification accuracy.

### Future Work

Our work is ongoing, with plans to develop a mobile application for automatic food identification. We also intend to expand the model's classification capability by incorporating additional food classes through data collection and annotation efforts across diverse geographic regions.
